                Dear Students, Parents, and Esteemed Staff,
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-base md:text-lg">
                It is with great joy and pride that I present our school magazine's maiden edition, marking an important chapter in Don Bosco School, Malda's history. This year is particularly special as we celebrate obtaining CBSE affiliation up to Senior Secondary level - a milestone reaffirming our commitment to quality education and holistic development.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-base md:text-lg">
                This achievement results from hard work, determination, and collaboration. Our dedicated faculty, staff, students, and parents have all played integral roles in realizing this dream. We can now offer an enhanced curriculum, new opportunities, and greater resources to help students excel in academics and co-curricular activities.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-base md:text-lg">
                Our vision has always been to create a nurturing environment promoting intellectual growth, values-based learning, and leadership development. With Senior Secondary affiliation, we can provide a more comprehensive educational experience preparing students for global success.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-base md:text-lg">
                As we reflect on our achievements, I urge students to continue striving for excellence. Let us remain focused on nurturing responsible, compassionate individuals who will contribute positively to society.
            </p>
