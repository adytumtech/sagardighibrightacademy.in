            <strong>Saint John Bosco</strong>, known as Don Bosco, was an Italian Roman Catholic priest, educator, and writer of the 19th century who dedicated his life to the betterment of education. Born on August 16, 1815, in the village of Becchi, Italy, he overcame poverty by working odd jobs to fund his education. He was ordained a priest on June 5, 1841.

            Don Bosco developed <strong>"The Preventive System"</strong> of education, based on <strong>Reason, Religion, and Kindness</strong>. Unlike punitive methods, his approach encouraged obedience through persuasion and love. He believed education should nurture the <em>mental, emotional, moral, and spiritual</em> growth of pupils, famously saying: <em>"It is not sufficient to love the young; they must know that they are loved."</em>

            "You are young, and that is enough to make me love you very much."
          </blockquote>

            Even 125 years after his death, his legacy thrives through his followers, who continue his mission with the same zeal. His philosophy remains central to Don Bosco schools worldwide, including ours in Malda, where we embody his vision of holistic, compassionate education.
