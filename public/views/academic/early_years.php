            Early years in Don Bosco Malda aims to ensure that the beginning of a child’s education is positive, cheerful and full of colourful experiences. Here students are taught to learn and grow academically and personally. Early Years in DBM consists of Nursery, Junior KG and Senior KG, inculcating basic skills. The three stages of early years are designed to ensure that all children here are kept in a warm, healthy and safe environment. Here each child is encouraged to discover numerous new concepts through playful and jovial activities. Children here learn through playful act with their peers, adults and by themselves. We also run several programs like toddlers program and adventure events for children who are 18 to 36 months to motivate the children as well as the parents. Apart from this we give prime importance on learning through drawing pictures, colouring or chalking on the boards. Countless innovative games like balancing beam, Pictionary, puzzles, listening games and many more. Through all these range of activities we aim to imbibe independent skills into young minds. Hence choosing DBM for your kid makes the difference between an exceptional child and an average one
