Each learner is different in terms of academic standards, learning skills, classroom teachings and academic performance. Each of them learns at his/her own pace. This situation calls for remedial classes where we provide subject-wise remedial classes to each student enrolled in the day boarding and boarding segment. The weekly or monthly assessments will decide if any students qualify for remedial classes. Each class does not permit more than 10 pupils. Children here get guidance from our trained teachers in major subjects. Teachers take a little more care about them and attending to them personally. Explaining the concept of the subject until they understand is also a major concern for us. Each student is expected to maintain a minimum grade average of 60% each month, and when it is achieved the classes are discontinued. Get detailed assistance in academic writing and ability to perform at the highest level is our foremost concern. As educators we aspire to develop our children holistically.
