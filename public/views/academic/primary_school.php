            Life in Primary Years for the budding scholars is generally self-actualization and self-realization. Here we help them to nurture their skills through integration of technology in learning processes. Apart from classroom studies they are helped to discover their talents. Lessons are made effective and enjoyable through PPT sessions, interactive classrooms, outdoor activities and educational trips. Primary Years at DBM serve more of a research centre rather than only mugging up. A variety of teaching method is followed with uniqueness based on CBSE curriculum. Teachers insist on one to one interaction and help to evoke curiosity within each scholar. Apart from academic subjects such as English, Bengali, Hindi, Mathematics, Social Studies, Environmental Studies, Computers, General Knowledge and Cultural studies, DBM offers a myriad selection of extra-curricular activities which includes dance, elocution, quiz, linguistics, music, karate, clay modelling and photography. The entire phase in elementary grade is a continuous process through daily observations, projects and worksheets.
