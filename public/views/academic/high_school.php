         High School in DBM is structured and designed to allow students to spent ample amount of curriculum time with the teachers. In high school we aim to inspire, encourage and develop unique potential within the pupil. We ensure that they should be intellectually creative, curious and conscious of their responsibilities. In this crucial four years before attending college, we strive to guide them in every possible ways and prepare them for the world of work. We make them realise the opportunity to progress and achieve long-term goals. Our objective is to enable young adults to develop specialised skills and expertise in every subject in the stream of their choice.
